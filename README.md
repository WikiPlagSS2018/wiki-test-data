# Wiki test data

Contains some small sample XML-Files extracted from the Wikipedia Articles XML-Dump of October 2017.
All samples contain well formed XML. Closing tags such as ```</page>``` and ```</mediawiki> ``` were added manually in order to achieve this. The original dump has a size of ~4.5 GB compressed and ~18 GB uncompressed. The lastest XML-Articles dump can be obtained from [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/dewiki/latest/dewiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2).
